# StravaPebble

An Android app to bring back the Strava integration to Pebble watches

## Project Status - New live by a Pebble lover
I have contact the original creator @subu28 of this project and now I will try my best to maintain this project for as long as my Pebble 2 HR+ will survive.

Please add issues by using the templates if you encounter any difficulties.

This app will be downloadable through the Google Play Store at the moment I have received my Pebble 2 HR+ (second hand) so I can start testing the Strava interactions.
